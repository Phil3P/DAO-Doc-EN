This document is intended for both experienced individuals with DAOs and those who are less familiar. It is written with a multi-level approach so that everyone can find useful information. Beginners can focus on the 1-star sections that simplify and explain the concepts in more detail in the 3-star sections. For those with a basic understanding of DeFi and DAOs, the 1 and 2-star sections will help them better understand the context and overall mechanisms.
